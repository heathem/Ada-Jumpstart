#Assignment: Create a student account generator program


#Create three arrays to: contain student names, store student ID numbers, and contain student email addresses

names = []
id_numbers = []
emails = []


#Write a times loop that asks the user to enter in 5 student names (1st and Last) and store those values in the first array in all UPPERCASE
#generate random ID numbers from 111111 to 999999 and put these values to the id_numbers array
#generate student email addresses in the format: (first initial) + (last name) + (last three digits of student id number)@adadevelopersacademy.org
#converted the random id numbers to a string to be able to display just the last three digits in the email

5.times do
	puts "Enter student's first name:"
	first_name = gets.chomp.upcase
	puts "Enter the student's last name:"
 	last_name = gets.chomp.upcase
	id_number = rand(111111..999999)
  id_number = id_number.to_s

  names << "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

	id_numbers << id_number

	emails << "#{first_name[0,1]}#{last_name}#{id_number[3..5]}@adadevelopersacademy.org"

end


#print out all the student names, ID numbers, and email addresses in parallel. I looked up using [index] (curious if [i] will work the same way) on stackoverflow.com. Also curious, the example I found uses commas between the separate arrays, but will plus signs work? Like I learned in JumpStart about concatenating
i = 0
names.count.times do
	puts "#{names[i]} #{id_numbers[i]} #{emails[i]}"
  i += 1
end
