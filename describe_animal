puts "How many legs does the animal have?"
leg_count = gets.chomp

puts "Does the animal have scales, feathers, or hair?"
skin = gets.chomp

puts "Is the animal aquatic, terrestrial, or aerial?"
environment = gets.chomp


#Use those variables to describe the animal in the console output

puts "The animal is a " + type + ". " +
	 "It has #{leg_count} legs. " +
	 "The animal has " + skin +
