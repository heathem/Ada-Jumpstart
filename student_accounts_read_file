#Assignment: Rework my student_accounts2 generator program to add the ability to read from a file


#Create a blank array of hashes for student data

student_data = []

#This will read from a file entered in here in the code and does the same thing
	#as student_accounts2, only reads from a file. In this case, I made a txt file
	#in my ada/jumpstart folder with each name listed on it's own line. I split the
	#first and last names to be able to make the email (see student_accounts2), and
	#double split the first name in case of first names that have a space in them.

File.open("d:/ada/jumpstart/student_names.txt") do |f|
	f.each_line do |line|
	last_name = line.split.last
	first_name = line.split(line.split.last).first

	id_number = rand(111111..999999)
	id_number = id_number.to_s

	if first_name.split.length == 2
		email = "#{first_name.split.first[0,1]}#{first_name.split.last[0,1]}#{last_name}#{id_number[3..5]}@adadevelopersacademy.org"
	else
		email = "#{first_name[0,1]}#{last_name}#{id_number[3..5]}@adadevelopersacademy.org"
	end

	new_student = {"name" => "#{first_name}#{last_name}", "ID" => "#{id_number}", "email" => "#{email}"}

	student_data << new_student

	end
end

#Print out all the student names, ID numbers, and email addresses in parallel.
	#Uses number of objects in the student_data array to determine how many times
	#the loop will run, and i to cycle through those objects

i = 0
student_data.count.times do
	puts "#{student_data[i]["name"]} #{student_data[i]["ID"]} #{student_data[i]["email"]}"
  i += 1
end
