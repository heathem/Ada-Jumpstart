#Assignment: Make an electronic election program that tracks votes, total votes,
  #and determines winner. Input - Poll 10 people for their vote. Output - Print
  #the total votes cast as well as the winner. Handle ties for a winner. Handle
  #grammer of vote summary saying "vote" or "votes" appropriately.

  #variable to help decide if the user would like to add another vote.
